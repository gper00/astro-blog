</div>

A simple and minimalist blog platform, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It is a fork of the [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) template, which was loosely based on the [Astro Micro](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/) theme by [trevortylerlee](https://github.com/trevortylerlee).

## Features

*   [Astro](https://astro.build/)'s [Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) architecture for selective hydration and client-side interactivity while maintaining fast static site rendering.
*   [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) color conventions for automatic light and dark theme styling. Features accessible, theme-aware UI components for navigation, buttons, and more.
*   [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) for enhanced code block styling, syntax highlighting, and code block titles.
*   Blog authoring with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for component-rich content and $\LaTeX$ math rendering via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).
*   Astro [View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) in <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr> mode for smooth route animations.
*   SEO optimization with granular metadata and [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) tag control for each post.
*   [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed and sitemap generation.
*   Subpost support for breaking long content into digestible parts and organizing related series.
*   Author profiles with a dedicated authors page and multi-author post support.
*   Project tags with a dedicated tags page for post categorization and discovery.
*   Custom Callout component variants for enhanced technical writing.
